	 * at the start. The running speed starts slowly, 
	 * but gets faster each minute after you hear this 
	 * signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed 
	 * each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember 
	 * to run in a straight line, and run as long as 
	 * possible. The second time you fail to complete 
	 * a lap before the sound, your test is over. The 
	 * test will begin on the word start. 
	 * On your mark, get ready, start.
